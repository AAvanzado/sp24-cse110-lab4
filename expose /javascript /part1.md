## Question 1
Line 9 prints `vaules added: 20`

## Question 2
Line 13 prints `final result: 20` 

## Question 3
Line 9 prints `values added: 20`

## Question 4
The code returns an error because the result variable was declared with the `let` keyword and thus its scope is only within the if block, where it was declared, and not within the else block.

## Question 5
The code returns an error because in line 7 we tried to reassign the `const` variable `result` which is not allowed.

## Question 6
Just like in question 5, the code returns an error because in line 7 we tried to reassign the `const` variable `result` which is not allowed.
